muSE - short for 'muvee Symbolic Expressions' - is a Scheme dialect intended for use as an embedded language. It has some unique language features such as first class macros, simple general read-time evaluation syntax, vectors and hashtables that can be used as functions, and extensive use of pattern matching bind.

**Highlight**: muSE is used as an embedded language to specify the "styles" in [muvee Reveal](http://www.muvee.com/en/products/reveal/), launched on 11 June 2008.

## Language and library features ##
  * Provides lexically scoped closures as well as dynamically scoped blocks.
  * Expressive reader macro system where macros are first class citizens (i.e. can be passed around as arguments to functions, assigned to variables, etc.)
  * Uniform use of pattern matching for variable binding.
  * Generic functions ([doc][gfndoc])
  * Many polymorphic primitives - including map, filter, reduce, get, put, and some others.
  * An extremely easy to use Objective-C bridge (only on MacOSX).
  * A simple module system.
  * Flexible [exception handling][ExceptionHandling]
    * Resumable exceptions
    * Exception handler dispatch using pattern matching bind.
    * Simple cleanup mechanism
  * Reduce the need for local variables using [TheAndIt][].
  * Built-in support for [JSON][jsondoc].
  * Built-in support for reading/writing [a subset of XML][xmldoc].

## Integration features ##

  * C-based, [fairly well documented][apidoc], simple embedding API. Can call as well as be called from C/C++ code.
  * Compact - Its easy to strip down the feature set to whatever subset of the core language you need.
  * Extensible notion of objects to add new kinds of things to muSE in native code. Vectors, hashtables and ports (for I/O) are provided using this mechanism.
  * Ability to add C/C++ based native functionality in the form of plugin DLLs.
  * Ability to create [StandAloneExecutables][]
  * Supports multiple independent environments
  * Liberal license terms - can use in commercial applications without publishing source code.
